# CRM for Students

## Project Overview
-> The main idea of this project is to help my students keep track of the number of private lessons they have taken and the payments they have made.<br>
-> Initially, I intended to add payment tracking directly into the project. However, I discovered a more straightforward method to handle this aspect.

## Functionality
- **Basic CRUD Operations:** The app currently supports create, update and delete functionalities.
- **Potential Enhancements:** Integrating the Stripe API and making the UI design better could make this a very useful application.

## Status
- **Functionality:** Yes, the app has all the basic functionalities.
- **Appearance:** Yes :)) if you are blind :)).

Did I make it alone? No way. I followed some YouTube tutorials to learn the basics and something for the database connections.
